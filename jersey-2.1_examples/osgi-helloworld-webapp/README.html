  <body>
      <h1>HelloWorld OSGi Example</h1>

      <p>This example demonstrates how to develop a simple OSGi WAR bundle containing a RESTful hello world web service</p>

      <h2>Contents</h2>
      <p>The example WAR (see the <tt>war-bundle</tt> module) consists of two Jersey resources:</p>
      <dl>
          <dt><code>com.sun.jersey.samples.helloworld.HelloWorldResource</code></dt>
          <dd>that produces a textual response to an HTTP GET</dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
          <dt><code>com.sun.jersey.samples.helloworld.AnotherResource</code></dt>
          <dd>that produces a different textual response to an HTTP GET.
              The purpose of this resource is to show how to define multiple
              web resources within a web application.</dd>
      </dl>
    <p>The mapping of the URI path space is presented in the following table:</p>
	<table border="1">
	<tr>
	<th>URI path</th>
	<th>Resource class</th>
	<th>HTTP methods</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	<td>/helloworld</td>
	<td>HelloWorldResource</td>
	<td>GET</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	<td>/another</td>
	<td>AnotherResource</td>
	<td>GET</td>
	</tr>
	</table>

      <h2>Running the Example</h2>
      <p>To run the example, you would need to build the WAR file
      and install it to an OSGi runtime (e.g. Apache Felix) together with other OSGi modules.
      Look at the attached <tt>functional-test</tt> module for details on the programatical runtime configuration.
      To build the war archive and run the tests, you can just launch
<pre>%mvn clean install
</pre>
