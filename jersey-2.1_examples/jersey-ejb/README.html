        <h2>Running the Example</h2>

        <p>This sample utilizes Java EE features in the GlassFish container</p>

        <p>Build the application WAR file by executing maven 2 from the project directory:</p>
        <blockquote><code>mvn -Dmaven.test.skip clean package</code></blockquote>

        <p>To deploy on a running GlassFish container, you would then typically need to launch:</p>
        <blockquote><code>$AS_HOME/bin/asadmin deploy target/jersey-ejb.war</code></blockquote>
        <p>Another option is to deploy using <a href="http://localhost:4848/">GlassFish administrator console GUI</a></p>

        <p>From a web browser, visit:</p>
        <blockquote><code><a href="http://localhost:8080/jersey-ejb">http://localhost:8080/jersey-ejb</a></code>
