<h1>Managed Client Example</h1>
<p>This example demonstrates a simple usage of Jersey Managed Client feature.</p>
<h2>Contents</h2>
<p>The mapping of the URI path space is presented in the following table:</p>
<table border="1">
    <tr>
        <th>URI path</th>
        <th>Resource class</th>
        <th>HTTP methods</th>
        <th>Allowed values</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>/public/a</td>
        <td>PublicResource</td>
        <td>GET</td>
        <td>&nbsp;</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>/public/b</td>
        <td>PublicResource</td>
        <td>GET</td>
        <td>&nbsp;</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>/internal/a</td>
        <td>InternalResource</td>
        <td>GET</td>
        <td>&nbsp;</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>/internal/b</td>
        <td>InternalResource</td>
        <td>GET</td>
        <td>&nbsp;</td>
    </tr>
</table>
<p>
    In the example, the requests to a <em>public resource</em> deployed on <code>/public/</code> path are forwarded
    to an <em>internal resource</em> (deployed on <code>/internal/</code> path) using injected
    <a href="https://jax-rs-spec.java.net/nonav/2.0/apidocs/javax/ws/rs/client/WebTarget.html">javax.ws.rs.client.WebTarget</a>
    instances produced using 2 separate managed clients each of the managed clients using it's own custom configuration.
</p>
<p>
    An access to internal resource methods is guarded by a container request filter (<code>CustomHeaderFilter</code>)
    which rejects any request that does not contain expected custom header set to an expected value. In the example,
    the 2 managed clients (used by a public resource to access the methods on the internal resource) are configured
    with custom configurations, each containing a registration of a custom client request filter that is instructed
    to append a required custom header and value to every outgoing request. Only with managed client support working
    properly, the public resource is able to successfully retrieve data from the internal resource.
</p>

<h2>Running the Example</h2>
<p>Run the example as follows:</p>
<blockquote><pre>
mvn clean package jetty:run</pre></blockquote>
<p>
    This deploys current example on the local host. You can then access WADL description of the deployed application at
    <a href="http://localhost:8080/managed-client-webapp/application.wadl">
        http://localhost:8080/managed-client-webapp/application.wadl</a>.
</p>
<p>
    You can access public resource of this application using curl:
</p>
<blockquote><code>curl -v -H "Accept: text/plain" http://localhost:8080/managed-client-webapp/public/a</code></blockquote>
<blockquote><code>curl -v -H "Accept: text/plain" http://localhost:8080/managed-client-webapp/public/b</code></blockquote>
<p>
    In this example you should see the returned response message body contains "a" or "b" respectively upon successful invocation.
</p>
<p>
    You may also verify that access to internal resource is not possible without including a proper header in the request. First
    try to access the internal resource without any custom header:
</p>
<blockquote><code>curl -v -H "Accept: text/plain" http://localhost:8080/managed-client-webapp/internal/a</code></blockquote>
<blockquote><code>curl -v -H "Accept: text/plain" http://localhost:8080/managed-client-webapp/internal/b</code></blockquote>
<p>
    In both cases a <code>HTTP 403 Forbidden.</code> response is returned. Now lets try to access the resource once again, but
    this time we'll include also the expected custom headers:
</p>
<blockquote>
    <code>curl -v -H "Accept: text/plain" -H "custom-header:a" http://localhost:8080/managed-client-webapp/internal/a</code>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    <code>curl -v -H "Accept: text/plain" -H "custom-header:b" http://localhost:8080/managed-client-webapp/internal/b</code>
</blockquote>
<p>
    Finally, you should see the invocation succeeded and the returned response message body contains "a" or "b" respectively.
