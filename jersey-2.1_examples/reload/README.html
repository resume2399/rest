<h1>Resource Configuration Reload Example</h1>

<p>This example demonstrates how to create a simple Jersey application with resource reloading capability
    using <a href="http://grizzly.java.net">Grizzly HTTP Server container</a>.</p>

<h2>Contents</h2>

<p>The mapping of the URI path space is presented in the following table:</p>
<table border="1">
    <tr>
        <th>URI path</th>
        <th>Resource class</th>
        <th>Content</th>
        <th>HTTP methods</th>
    </tr>

    <tr>
        <td>/flights/arrivals</td>
        <td>org.glassfish.jersey.examples.reload.ArrivalsResource</td>
        <td>Dummy Arrivals Information</td>
        <td>GET</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
        <td>/flights/departures</td>
        <td>org.glassfish.jersey.examples.reload.DeparturesResource</td>
        <td>Dummy Departures Information</td>
        <td>GET</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
        <td>/flights/stats</td>
        <td>org.glassfish.jersey.examples.reload.StatsResource</td>
        <td>Statistics on application resource utilization</td>
        <td>GET</td>
    </tr>

</table>

<p>The application gets configured via a plain text file named <code>resources</code>. The file contains a list of
    resource classes
    to be published by the application. After the application gets started, it checks the file regularily each 2 seconds
    and reloads the application
    as file updates are being detected.
</p>

<h2>Running the Example</h2>

<p>Run the example as follows:</p>
<blockquote><pre>
mvn clean compile exec:java</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>This deploys current example using
    <a href="http://grizzly.java.net/">Grizzly container</a>. StatsResource should
    be available at <a href="http://localhost:8080/flights/stats">http://localhost:8080/flights/stats</a>
</p>

<p>You may want to check the other resources as well:
<ul>
    <li><a href="http://localhost:8080/flights/departures">http://localhost:8080/flights/departures</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://localhost:8080/flights/arrivals">http://localhost:8080/flights/arrivals</a></li>
</ul>
Updated information on number of hits should be available at <a href="http://localhost:8080/flights/stats">http://localhost:8080/flights/stats</a>.</p>

<p>Now you can try to edit the <code>resources</code> file and comment the stats resource out by using the
    <code>#</code> prefix.
    The point is you leave the application running while editing the file. The changes wil get picked up automatically.
    No need to manually restart the application.
    The <code>resource</code> file content should now look like follows:
<pre>
org.glassfish.jersey.examples.reload.DeparturesResource
org.glassfish.jersey.examples.reload.ArrivalsResource
#org.glassfish.jersey.examples.reload.StatsResource
</pre>
Once you save the change, the stats resource should not be available, but the other, departures/arrivals, resources
should remain functional.
</p>
<p>Now you can revert the change back and check the stats resource is back providing actual statistics information.</p>
